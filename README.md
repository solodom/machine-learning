# machine-learning-in-action
This project is an implementation of machine learning algorithms according to the book 《machine learning in action》 written by Peter Harrington. It is a great book, and this project is just for learning the book by practice and self improvment.The dataset used are all from the book related website: https://github.com/pbharrin/machinelearninginaction3x, and this github is just used to store the code and dataset, more details in my csdn blog : https://blog.csdn.net/solodom.
$$p(x) = \prod_{j=1}^{n}p(x_{j};\mu_{j},\sigma_{j}^{2})$$
